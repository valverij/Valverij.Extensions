# Valverij.Extentions #

This is a project consisting of extension methods I find myself frequently recreating. It targets .NET Standard so it may be used with a wider variety of projects.

## Valverij.Extensions ##

The Valverij.Extensions package consists of general extension methods. No dependencies required.

## Valverij.Extensions.Web ##

The Valverij.Extensions.Web package consists of extension methods for use in web applications and REST services/consumers.

There may be some dependencies on common packages for the web, such as Newtonsoft.Json.
